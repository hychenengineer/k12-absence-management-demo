# SubConnect: K-12 Absence Management & Substitute Placement Engine

An enterprise reference implementation of a modern K-12 teacher absence management and automated substitute placement platform, built with **.NET 10 / C# Web API**, **React 18 TypeScript**, and **Azure SignalR real-time WebSockets**.

> **Architecture Overview:** Engineered to solve the high-concurrency 6:00 AM district call-out rush with zero-polling WebSocket broadcasts, multi-persona qualification matching (Teacher, School Administrator, Substitute), and asynchronous notification worker dispatchers.

## 1. Quick Setup & Run Guide

### ⚡ Option A: Zero-Setup Standalone Executable (Recommended)

**No Node.js, npm, or .NET SDK installation required!**

1. **[Download Demo-win-x64.zip (GitHub Release)](https://github.com/hychenengineer/k12-absence-management-demo/releases)**
2. Extract the ZIP archive anywhere on a Windows machine.
3. Double-click **`RedRover.Demo.exe`** (or the launcher).
4. The application initializes SQLite, seeds district data, and **automatically opens your browser to `http://localhost:5000`** with the full React 18 UI, REST API, and SignalR live!

---

### 🛠️ Option B: Run from Source (.NET & Node.js)

#### Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK (v8.0 or v10.0)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js (v18+) & npm](https://nodejs.org/)

#### Step 1: Start the Backend (.NET Web API)
Open a terminal and start the .NET Web API:

```bash
cd src/RedRover.Api
dotnet run
```

- **Application & API URL**: `http://localhost:5000` *(serves both embedded React UI and REST API)*
- **Interactive Swagger Docs**: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
- **Database**: An SQLite database (`redrover.db`) is automatically initialized and seeded with schools, teachers, substitutes, and baseline absence records on startup.

#### Step 2: Start the Frontend for Active Development (Optional)
If modifying React source code with Vite Hot Module Reloading:

```bash
cd src/redrover-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

- **Vite Dev URL**: `http://localhost:5173` (proxies `/api` and `/hubs` to port 5000)

#### Step 3 (Optional): Start the Azure Background Worker
To run the Azure Functions SMS burst dispatcher:

```bash
cd src/RedRover.Worker
dotnet run
```

## 2. Concrete Walkthrough Example: Emergency Absence & Substitute Placement

This step-by-step scenario walks through how the three primary personas (**Teacher**, **Administrator**, and **Substitute**) interact with the platform in real time with zero page reloads.

### Scenario: High School Chemistry Teacher Calls Out Sick

#### Step 1: Teacher Creates the Absence
1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
2. Click the **Teacher** tab in the top navigation bar.
3. In the **Teacher Persona** dropdown, select **Sarah Johnson (Lincoln High School — Science, Room 204)**.
4. Select the date (e.g., tomorrow), duration (**Full Day**), reason (**Illness / Medical**), and enter notes: `"Lab experiment safety sheets are printed on my desk. Period 4 has Quiz 3."`
5. Click **Create Absence**.
   - *Behind the Scenes*: The .NET API records the absence with status `Open`, triggers the qualification matching engine, and broadcasts an `AbsenceCreated` event across SignalR.

#### Step 2: Administrator Assigns the Shift
1. Switch to the **School Admin** tab (or open it side-by-side in a second browser window).
2. Look at the **Absence Board**:
   - The new absence for **Sarah Johnson** appears immediately in the **Open / Unfilled** list via SignalR with zero page refreshing.
   - Note the **"Substitutes cannot claim directly"** badge: unassigned absences require admin dispatching.
3. Click the **Assign Sub** button on Sarah Johnson's card.
4. In the assignment modal, select qualified substitute **Alex Martinez** (certified in Science/Chemistry).
5. Click **Confirm Assignment**.
   - *Behind the Scenes*: The backend transitions the absence status to `Offered`, assigns `Alex Martinez`, and pushes an `AbsenceUpdated` SignalR broadcast.

#### Step 3: Substitute Reviews and Accepts the Offer
1. Switch to the **Substitute** tab.
2. In the **Substitute Profile** dropdown, select **Alex Martinez**.
3. Under **Assigned Shifts Waiting for Your Decision**, you will see the offered shift at Lincoln High School with two action buttons:
   - **Accept Shift** (Green)
   - **Decline Shift** (Red)
4. Click **Accept Shift**.
   - *Behind the Scenes*: A `POST /api/absences/{id}/respond` request is sent to the backend. The API transitions the status from `Offered` to `Filled`, timestamps `FilledAt`, and updates the optimistic concurrency version token.

#### Step 4: Real-Time Confirmation
1. Switch back to the **School Admin** tab.
2. Observe that Sarah Johnson's absence has automatically moved to the **Filled Absences** section, showing assigned substitute **Alex Martinez**.
3. The top **District Fill Rate** metric counter dynamically updates in real-time.

---

### Bonus: Concurrency Collision Test (Race Condition Simulation)
1. On the **School Admin** tab, click **Live Board**.
2. Click the **Race Test** button.
3. This fires two simultaneous substitute claims at the exact same millisecond with conflicting expected version tokens.
4. The first claim succeeds (`200 OK`), while the second is trapped by EF Core optimistic concurrency and rejected with `409 Conflict`, demonstrating zero double-booking under high morning concurrency.

### Architectural Rationale

1. **Always-On Azure App Service for Core API**:
   - Between 6:00 AM and 6:30 AM, hundreds of teachers report morning absences simultaneously.
   - Hosting the core REST API on an Always-On App Service prevents 3–5 second serverless cold starts and preserves pre-warmed database connection pools for steady sub-50ms responses.

2. **Azure SignalR Service Connection Offloading**:
   - School administrators keep attendance dashboards running throughout the school day.
   - Offloading persistent WebSocket connections to Azure SignalR Service prevents API server socket exhaustion and supports instant fan-out without client-side polling.

3. **Serverless Azure Function for Spiky SMS Bursts**:
   - The 6:00 AM substitute broadcast dispatches thousands of outbound SMS alerts in under 2 minutes, then sits idle for the rest of the day.
   - Decoupling notification delivery to Azure Service Bus and a serverless worker allows auto-scaling across dozens of instances during the surge, minimizing compute costs.

4. **Optimistic Concurrency Control (Zero Double-Booking)**:
   - Uses EF Core row version tokens (`Guid Version`) with database-level concurrency checks.
   - If two substitutes attempt to claim or accept the same position simultaneously, the winner receives `200 OK` while the second transaction is safely trapped and returned as `409 Conflict`.
